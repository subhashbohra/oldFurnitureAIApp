# FurnitureAIApp
Create and AI app which will scan your furniture and provide the condition state and predict estimated resale value
✅ Frontend (Flutter/React Native)
✅ Backend (FastAPI for AI integration)
✅ ML Models (YOLOv8 for object detection, CNN for condition assessment, XGBoost for price prediction)
✅ Dataset preprocessing scripts
✅ Scraping scripts for second-hand price data


Next Steps:
Train the AI Model:

Get a dataset of furniture images for condition assessment from Kaggle (e.g., "Furniture Condition Dataset").
Use second-hand furniture prices from OLX/Quikr via web scraping.
Deploy the API & Mobile App:

Host the FastAPI backend on AWS/GCP.
Build a Flutter/React Native app for capturing photos and fetching price estimates.
Improve AI Detection:

Integrate thermal imaging (if feasible) for termite detection.
Fine-tune XGBoost model for better price prediction.

# FurnitureAIApp
Create and AI app which will scan your furniture and provide the condition state and predict estimated resale value
âœ… Frontend (Flutter/React Native)
âœ… Backend (FastAPI for AI integration)
âœ… ML Models (YOLOv8 for object detection, CNN for condition assessment, XGBoost for price prediction)
âœ… Dataset preprocessing scripts
âœ… Scraping scripts for second-hand price data

Iâ€™ll generate the base code and share it here. Give me a moment. ðŸš€

Next Steps:
Train the AI Model:

Get a dataset of furniture images for condition assessment from Kaggle (e.g., "Furniture Condition Dataset").
Use second-hand furniture prices from OLX/Quikr via web scraping.
Deploy the API & Mobile App:

Host the FastAPI backend on AWS/GCP.
Build a Flutter/React Native app for capturing photos and fetching price estimates.
Improve AI Detection:

Integrate thermal imaging (if feasible) for termite detection.
Fine-tune XGBoost model for better price prediction.
